# Rules

Every URL the tool loads passes through the same checks before any request is made:[^source][^review]

- **Same origin only.** The URL's origin must equal the page's origin, and the scheme must be `http:` or `https:`.
- **Inside the bundle root.** The URL path must start with the root path, which must end in `/`; neither the root nor the URL may carry a username, password, query or fragment.
- **No encoded separators.** Paths containing an encoded `/`, `\` or `%` are rejected.
- **No traversal or schemes.** Backslashes, control characters, absolute paths and non-http schemes are rejected in internal references.
- **No redirects and no credentials.** Fetch uses `credentials: "omit"` and `redirect: "error"`, so a response cannot bounce the request to another host.

# Effect

A malicious bundle cannot probe other hosts, read another origin, or smuggle a different resource in through a redirect. Images in bundle content follow the same rules; external and `data:` images from content are not shown, and valid bundle images are displayed from blob URLs. The only same-origin network images the page may load are its own web app manifest icons and screenshot, allowed by `img-src 'self'` for install surfaces; the renderer never emits a network image `src`. The optional service worker caches only the app shell and never intercepts bundle requests, so the bounds are unchanged. The only `data:` image the page itself uses is its inline SVG favicon, which is page chrome and not part of a bundle.[^review]

# Limits of the control

The rules constrain URLs, not the server's mapping from URLs to files. Symlinks, internal rewrites and a misconfigured deploy must be handled on the server. Prefer a dedicated static origin without sensitive routes.
