# Goal

Find one concept, or a group of concepts, without reading the whole graph. The
filters dock at the right; the legend docks at the left.[^interface]

# Search by text

1. Open the **filters** panel and type in **Search**.
2. Matching is a case-insensitive substring match.
3. Use the **in** menu to scope the search to All fields, Title, Description,
   Type, Tags or Path. All fields is the default.

# Filter by attributes

Each of **Kinds**, **Types**, **Tags** and **Status** has a **Select …** button
that opens a searchable list. Clicking an entry cycles it through three states:[^source]

- **none** — the attribute does not affect the filter;
- **include** (shown with ✓) — keep only nodes with it;
- **exclude** (shown with −) — remove nodes with it.

Choose **Clear** in a list to reset that attribute. Selected attributes also
appear as chips in the panel: click a chip's label to toggle include and exclude,
or its `×` to remove it. Tags nest, so selecting a tag such as `ml` also keeps
its sub-tags such as `ml/vision`.

# Use the legend

The legend lists each group with its colour and count. Click a row to keep only
that group; click more rows to add them, and click a selected row again to clear
it. Hovering a row highlights the group the same way as hovering a node. While a
filter is active, hovering adds to the standing selection instead of replacing
it.

# Clear everything

Choose **Clear filters** at the foot of the panel to drop every search, kind,
type, tag and status selection at once.
