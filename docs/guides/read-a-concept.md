# Goal

Read a concept and move from it to the pages it points at, without going back to
the graph.

# Open a page

Click a node to open it in the preview panel. A concept or index renders its
Markdown. A node with a dashed ring is not loaded yet: click it to load the
content, then click again to open it.

# Move through a page

- **Links** to other concepts open in the same preview; a link to an `#anchor`
  scrolls to that heading; external links open in a new browser tab.[^source]
- **Footnotes** jump to the note and back.
- Use the **‹** and **›** buttons in the preview header, `Alt`+`←` and
  `Alt`+`→`, or the mouse's back and forward buttons to step through the pages
  you have visited.

# Jump between pages that share a tag

Pages show their tags as chips. Hover a chip on a desktop, or tap it on touch, to
list the other pages that carry the same tag; click one to open it. Choosing
**expand in graph** on the chip clears the preview and filters the graph to that
tag instead.

# Close the preview

Choose **Close**, press `Escape`, or click outside the page.

# Where other files differ

Non-Markdown files open differently: an image shows the picture with a source
toggle, an attachment shows its details, and a PDF shows its metadata. See
[File and image preview](../interface/file-preview.md).[^preview]
