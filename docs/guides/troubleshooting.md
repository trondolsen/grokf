# The window shows an "Open folder" card

Nothing auto-loads when you open the file from disk. Choose **Open folder…** and
pick the bundle directory, or drag the folder onto the window. Auto-load works
only when the page is served over HTTP.[^source]

# A bundle behind a login or a redirect does not load

This is intended. The viewer omits credentials and rejects redirects, so a bundle
behind authentication, HTTP credentials or a redirect is deliberately
unsupported. Serve the bundle from plain static hosting instead of weakening the
URL controls. See [URL and network bounds](../security/url-and-network-bounds.md).[^bounds]

# Clicking a node loads instead of opening

A node with a dashed ring has unloaded content. Click it once to load; a concept
that reveals a deeper level needs a second click to open the preview.

# A page shows a "safety limit exceeded" notice

The Markdown renderer is bounded, so it refuses to render pathological input
rather than produce partial output. The same shared budget caps nesting, input
size, output size and search work. See
[Limits and budgets](../security/limits-and-budgets.md).[^limits]

# An image does not appear

Only images that live inside the bundle are shown. External, `data:` and raw
`blob:` images are not rendered, and the preview shows a short notice instead.

# A large bundle is slow to open

The crawl is lazy, so a large bundle means many requests. Publish small bundles,
or open the page with `?depth=N` to prefetch fewer levels and reveal the rest on
demand. See [URL parameters](../interface/url-parameters.md).
