# Panels

- **Filters** dock right: the search box, the Kinds, Types, Tags and Status
  filters, and **Clear filters**. Open or close it with the **Filters** tab.
- **Legend** docks left: the list of groups with their colours and counts; click
  a row to filter the graph to that group.
- **About** opens from the **grokf ▾** title as the startup panel. It holds a
  **Language** picker (a searchable dialog of every language, grouped by geographic
  region) and a **Runtime internals** link that opens the synthetic
  [`.runtime` directory](../interface/runtime.md).

On screens narrower than 760px the toolbar collapses behind the **☰** button and
the two panels slide behind their **Filters** and **Legend** tabs.[^design]
