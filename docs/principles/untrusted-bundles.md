# Principle

A bundle may come from anywhere: a folder the user picked, a drag-and-drop, or a website. The tool therefore treats a bundle as **untrusted data** and assumes its Markdown, frontmatter, links, images and attachments may be malformed or deliberately hostile.[^review]

# Defense in depth

No single control is trusted to be sufficient. The tool combines several layers:[^review]

- It parses raw Markdown and escapes at each output sink, so generated HTML is never re-parsed or substituted into attributes.
- It bounds URLs to the selected bundle root and the page's own origin.
- It caps files, bytes, graph size, references, images and decompression work.
- It ties preview state and loaded resources to the current bundle generation, so switching bundles cannot show stale content.

# Why not simply disable the risky features

The tool keeps inline images, footnotes, tables and on-demand loading because they are the point of exploring a bundle. The response is to make each feature safe within a bound, not to remove it. The cost is extra complexity and a set of documented behaviour changes.[^review]
