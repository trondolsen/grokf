# Context

The graph is drawn on an HTML canvas with no charting library. Node positions are found by a continuous **force simulation** in the style of `d3-force`, written from scratch.[^source]

# Forces

The simulation accumulates acceleration from several forces:[^source]

- **Many-body repulsion** between all nodes, approximated with a Barnes-Hut quadtree so the cost stays near `O(n log n)` instead of `O(n²)`.
- **Link forces** that pull connected nodes together, with different strengths for tree, reference and tag links.
- A weak **radial** force that gives the tree a ring structure by depth.
- A **collision** force that prevents overlap, using a uniform grid.
- A weak **centering** force.

# Integration

Velocities are updated with a velocity-Verlet step and clamped to a maximum speed and acceleration. A cooling factor `alpha` decays each tick and never drops below a floor, so the layout keeps a slow, continuous motion instead of freezing. Interaction that changes the layout — entering a directory, resetting, or dragging a node — raises `alpha` and re-energizes it, while a plain single click leaves the graph undisturbed.[^source]

# Shared physics

The force primitives (softened repulsion, link springs, centering, the acceleration clamp) and the velocity-Verlet integrator are factored into one **shared physics module**. The graph supplies its own bodies, Barnes-Hut repulsion, ring targets and collision, while the mascot animation reuses the same primitives and step with its own bodies, link topology and parameters — so both run the same simulation at the same pace. The mascot idles its loop as soon as the released figure has converged and while its panel is hidden, so it costs nothing outside the brief settle.

# Trade-offs

A continuous simulation keeps the graph alive and self-organising, but it costs CPU on every frame and never becomes pixel-stable. The tool therefore keeps the view framed while a fresh layout settles, and can skip animation when the user prefers reduced motion.
