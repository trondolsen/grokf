# What this bundle describes

This bundle documents the **OKF Graph Explorer**, a single-file browser tool for exploring Open Knowledge Format (OKF) bundles.[^readme] The bundle is itself OKF v0.2, so the tool can open and navigate it.

# Format and extension

The concepts use **OKF v0.2**: UTF-8 Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, where `type` is the only always-required field.[^spec] The bundle also follows the project's **OKF Praxis** extension: every concept sets `okfx.mode` (its Diátaxis mode) and `okfx.version: praxis/1`, and uses the recommended type vocabulary. OKF Praxis is optional and additive, so a reader that does not know it still reads the bundle as plain OKF v0.2.

# Provenance

The concepts are derived from the project's own files, named in each concept's `sources`. The most important are the README, the tool's single HTML file and the security review.[^readme][^source][^review] No concept claims verification it does not have: the `verified` field is absent, so the content is unverified.

# Scope

The knowledge model is `index.md` plus the files under `docs/`. Other Markdown files in the repository, such as `README.md` and the test documentation, are ordinary project documents and are not part of the bundle.
