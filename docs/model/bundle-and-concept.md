# Bundle and concept

An OKF **bundle** is a directory tree with one UTF-8 Markdown file per **concept**. A concept's identity is its file path relative to the bundle root, without the `.md` extension. `index.md` and `log.md` are reserved file names, not concepts.[^spec]

# What the tool reads

For every Markdown file the tool extracts two parts:[^source]

- the **frontmatter**, parsed as YAML between two `---` lines;
- the **body**, the remaining Markdown.

It uses these frontmatter fields directly: `type`, `title`, `description`, `tags` and `status`. A file named `index.md` is treated as an index file; every other Markdown file is a concept. Unknown fields are kept but not shown. It also reads `okfx.decks` — each page's deck membership — to build the bundle's decks; see [Declared decks](../interface/declared-decks.md).

# Fallbacks

A concept without a `title` is labelled with its file name. A concept without `type` still appears in the graph under "Other concepts". A missing `status` is not treated as an error.
