# What it is

The viewer adds a synthetic directory, `.runtime/`, that is not part of the bundle. It opens from the **Runtime internals** link in the About panel, and it contains generated Markdown pages that describe the running application:[^source]

- `index.md` – the entry point, with links to the other pages.
- `status.md` – revision, load source, depth limit, graph focus, preview path, search and filters.
- `bundle.md` – every file the viewer has loaded, with type, status and tags, plus a count of the http/https URL hosts (domains) those files reference.
- `graph.md` – how the graph is composed: nodes and links by kind, and concepts by type.
- `performance.md` – the CPU, GPU, memory, timing and network data the browser exposes, with SVG trend charts.
- `limits.md` – the bounds the viewer enforces, and the budget in use.

# How it behaves

The path uses a dot-directory, which the bundle rules reject, so it can never collide with a bundle file and is never fetched.[^source] The viewer keeps the directory out of the graph until you open it, and re-inserts it after every bundle rebuild so its pages stay reachable.

The pages are generated at read time and are not written to disk or cached. While a `.runtime` page is open, changing a filter, searching, loading more of the bundle or navigating regenerates it in place, keeping the scroll position, so the page reflects the current state as you read it. The `performance.md` page also refreshes about once a second while it is open and draws its frame rate, JS heap and blocking time as SVG time-series charts — one sample per second, up to a minute, oldest to newest — because those values move continuously. Browsers hide most CPU and GPU accounting, so that page reports the closest proxy the browser offers and says when a value is unavailable.
