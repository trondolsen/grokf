# What it is

grokf can be installed as a web app. The browser reads the web app manifest and,
when the site meets the installability rules, offers to install it; once
installed, grokf opens in its own window like a platform app.[^mdn-installable]
Installation needs `https://` or `localhost`, a manifest with a name, 192px and
512px icons, `start_url` and `display`.[^mdn-installable] A service worker is not
required for installation, but one gives an offline app shell.[^mdn-sw]

# Manifest

`favicons/site.webmanifest`, linked from `grokf.html`, sets:[^manifest][^w3c]

| Member | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id`, `start_url` | `/grokf.html` | The app's identity and the URL opened on launch. |
| `scope` | `/` | Documents the installed app claims. |
| `name`, `short_name` | "grokf – OKF graph explorer", "grokf" | The displayed names. |
| `display` | `standalone` | Launch without the browser's own UI. |
| `theme_color`, `background_color` | `#12141a` | The dark UI and the launch background. |
| `icons` | 192px and 512px PNG, plus the SVG | The app icons. |
| `screenshots` | one wide PNG | Extra context in richer install prompts. |

The 512px PNG is not declared `maskable`, because the figure reaches near the
edges; a device that masks icons will scale it down instead.

# Service worker

`grokf-sw.js` keeps only the app shell — `grokf.html`, the manifest and the
icons — so an installed grokf starts offline. It never caches or intercepts
bundle content: it handles only navigations, network-first, and lets every other
request pass through.[^sw] A copy that ships `grokf.html` without the worker
registers nothing and behaves exactly as before.[^source]

# Install affordance

`grokf.html` listens for `beforeinstallprompt`, keeps the event, and reveals an
**Install** button in the toolbar; the button calls the browser's own prompt.[^source]
The button stays hidden when grokf already runs installed
(`display-mode: standalone`). iOS does not fire that event, so installation there
uses the Share menu.[^mdn-installable] The steps per platform are in
[Install grokf as a web app](../guides/install-as-web-app.md).

# Security

To let the manifest, its icons and the screenshot load, the page's CSP allows
`manifest-src 'self'`, `worker-src 'self'` and same-origin images
(`img-src 'self'`). Bundle images are still shown only from blob URLs: the
renderer never emits a network image `src`, so `img-src 'self'` is page chrome,
not a way to load bundle content. See
[URL and network bounds](../security/url-and-network-bounds.md).
