# Goal

Browse a bundle stored on your own machine, without a web server.[^readme]

# Steps

1. Copy `okf-graph-explorer.html` into the folder you want to browse, or open the HTML file directly.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser.
3. Choose **Open folder…** and select the bundle directory, **or** drag the folder onto the window.

# What happens

The tool reads the Markdown files and shows one level at a time: `?depth=N` keeps deeper files hidden but available, and clicking a dashed node reveals the next level. Attachments and non-Markdown files appear as nodes and are read only when opened.[^source]

# Notes

- The folder picker uses the File System Access API when the browser provides it, and falls back to a directory file input otherwise.
- Directories whose name starts with `.` are skipped, and the read is bounded by the same file, byte and depth limits as server loading.
- On `file://`, auto-load is impossible; opening a folder is the intended path.[^readme]
