# What a preview uses

When a page is shared, the platform builds a preview card from the page's own
metadata. Mastodon reads the **Open Graph** tags: `og:title`, `og:description`
and `og:image`. The card's picture is `og:image`, and for the description it
falls back to the plain `<meta name="description">`.[^mastodon][^ogp] The web app
manifest is not used for link previews.

# What grokf declares

`grokf.html` declares a `website` Open Graph set — title, description and the
screenshot `grokf.png`[^image] as `og:image` — together with the matching
`twitter:*` tags.[^source] The image URLs are **relative** (`grokf.png`), and
Mastodon resolves a relative image against the shared page's URL.[^mastodon]

# Notes

- The card picture comes from `og:image`, not from the favicon; the favicon is
  only the browser-tab icon. A Mastodon card shows the picture, the title, the
  description and the site name from `og:site_name`.[^mastodon]
- Because the image URL is relative, a copy of the tool placed in any folder
  resolves it next to `grokf.html`. A platform that insists on an absolute
  image URL would need the canonical origin written in instead.[^ogp]
- The tags are page metadata only; they do not change the tool's behaviour.[^source]
